Knock the Expensive ag technology down a peg <br>
<br>
Thanks for checking out my project! <br>
<br>
The Mission: Make a fully functional Android and *iOS based application to do exactly what technologies like GreenStar from John Deere does. <br>
<br>
It's insane the amount the conglomorate agriculture companies charge to use their GPS and mapping systems. <br>
So it's fairly simple in terms of explaining the goal of Field Trak but I'm sure not as simple getting all the code set up. <br>
Basically, I'm trying to build an app that can use the GPS in an Android device to track where an Operator has been with a machine. <br>
It will need to keep track of where the device has been and possibly in the future predict where to go with the capabilities of auto-steer. <br>
This is probably a long ways away though. But the basic functionality of tracking where the device has been and saving it. Hoping to integrate cloud storage options as well as local. <br>
<br>
So to recap, <br>
<br>
Application Basics: <br>
  Map location data -- have signed up for Google Maps API <br>
  Store Location data -- for later review and comparison, be able to sync with cloud to access on different devices <br>
  *compatible with ISO - BUS -- capable of running farm implements that support ISO - BUS <br>
  *contracted hardware devices -- for the folks that don't have smartphones or devices that encounter problems running application <br>
<br>
*indicated a later down the road feature or product <br>
<br>
These are my goals, I am completely new to any type of development and will be learning Kotlin as this project moves forward. <br>
Any help is greatly appreciated. If you have questions, comments, or suggestions shoot me a message. <br>
<br>
Thanks again, <br>
