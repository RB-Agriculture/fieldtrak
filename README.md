Knock the Expensive ag technology down a peg

Thanks for checking out my project!

The Mission: Make a fully functional Android and *iOS based application to do exactly what technologies like GreenStar from John Deere does. 

It's insane the amount the conglomorate agriculture companies charge to use their GPS and mapping systems. 
So it's fairly simple in terms of explaining the goal of Field Trak but I'm sure not as simple getting all the code set up.
Basically, I'm trying to build an app that can use the GPS in an Android device to track where an Operator has been with a machine. 
It will need to keep track of where the device has been and possibly in the future predict where to go with the capabilities of auto-steer.
This is probably a long ways away though. But the basic functionality of tracking where the device has been and saving it. Hoping to integrate cloud storage options as well as local.
So to recap, 

Application Basics:
  Map location data -- have signed up for Google Maps API
  Store Location data -- for later review and comparison, be able to sync with cloud to access on different devices
  *compatible with ISO - BUS -- capable of running farm implements that support ISO - BUS
  *contracted hardware devices -- for the folks that don't have smartphones or devices that encounter problems running application


These are my goals, I am completely new to any type of development and will be learning Kotlin as this project moves forward.
Any help is greatly appreciated. If you have questions, comments, or suggestions shoot me a message. 

Thanks again,
\\Kyle
